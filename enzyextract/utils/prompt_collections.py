For each data point, you extract the kcat (turnover number), Km (Michaelis constant), kcat/Km (catalytic efficiency), and descriptor. 
When extracting, you are primarily interested in kcat with units time^-1, and Km with units of molarity. (ie. mM, nmol/mL, etc.) Therefore, you must exclude Vmax, specific activity, etc. Also exclude Ki.

kcat and Km should be formatted like so: 
"33 ± 0.3 s^-1" or "2.3 mM". Report the error if present. Keep original units and values (do not convert units), but you should attempt to clean up OCR errors. Be thorough and extract all data points present, including wild-type.

The kcat and Km value must correspond to the descriptor. The descriptor must contain all the information to uniquely identify the entry. 
It will most likely contain the enzyme and substrate, but it may also contain conditions like mutant code, organism, pH, temperature, solvent etc.

- If kcat or Km is reported relative to something else, use the special unit "% relative".
- When a factor of 10 is reported next to the unit (for example, kcat x 10^3, or 10^4 x Km (M)) it is sometimes ambiguous.

For FASTA AF000305, same as above.
For FASTA Z46823, this enzyme is also a sulfotransferase, but the organism is different. This still might be a identifier, since it's unlikely that a random sequence would also be a sulfotransferase.
